# UnrealGstreamer

inspired by https://github.com/wongfei/ue4-gstreamer 
but easy to use and easy to understand and easy to add feature :)
meson, cmake, vs2022 are dependency

all you have to do is type below, and build your project. then you'll get online streaming enabled component :) 
but, it is in alpha stage :( so it works, but not good. contributions are always welcome :)
> git submodule add git@github.com:CoLuthien/UnrealGStreamer.git Plugins/GStreamer \
 git submodule update --init --recursive \
